# FOSSEE-IIT-Bombay

I have created a Desktop App using Python (PyQt6 library) which has the features listed :
      - App consists of a canvas and two buttons.
      
      - First button: When clicked, a random geometric image from the open source repository (https://github.com/hfg-gmuend/openmoji/tree/master/src/symbols/geometric) should be downloaded and rendered at any random location on the canvas. This is selectable and movable. An image from that repository keeps on appearing whenever 
this button is clicked, without removing/overwriting the previous images.
      
      - Second button: This button will be used for grouping multiple images as a single object. You need to select multiple images and click the button. Those images 
will move as a single object thereafter.

      - Includes other feature and buttons like changing the size of the image
